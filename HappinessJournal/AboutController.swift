I was impressed that a method so simple could have a large impact on one's happiness and mental health, and I have been doing the exercise ever since.\n\nThe method was created by Martin Seligman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, who has been called the father of positive psychology. Along with a group of other psychologists, he conducted a study which showed that \"Three Good Things\" has a lasting effect on one's happiness and optimism, even if only done for a few weeks.\n\nI created this app because I wanted to use my deep interest in computer science to help people become happier. I hope you enjoy the app, and feel free to send me an email with feedback and/or suggestions from the settings. Most importantly, if you like the app, tell your friends about it!\n\n- Asher Dale"
